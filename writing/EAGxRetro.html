            <h1>Lessons from EAGx Boston 2022</h1>
                </p>
                <p>
                It’s not every day you get to fly across the country for free to hear some of the best problem-solvers in the world talk about the most important problems in the world. But this wasn’t just any day– this was EAGx Boston.
                </p>
                <p>
                EAGx was my first conference, so I focused on getting an understanding of how these events work, having a good time, and meeting good people.
                </p>
                <p>
                Most articles on how to get the most out of EAGx advise you to schedule as many one-on-ones as possible. I had about six, but note that I left a day early and many of these were “informal” one-on-ones with friends of friends or strangers I approached randomly instead of scheduling on Swapcard.
                </p>
                <p>
                Incidentally, approaching a random person in the convention hall and saying, “Hello. You look cool. Would you like to talk about X?” works surprisingly well, because you already both have common ground as Effective Altruists and you can probably find more common ground as you talk. In fact, this works surprisingly well in general if you are friendly and treat the stranger with respect. Granted, though, scheduling one-on-ones in advance better optimizes the people you meet.
                </p>
                <p>
                For scheduled one-on-ones, I spent about 15 minutes filling out my Swapcard profile, then messaged people in industries that interest me about what a conversation can do for both of us. As a first-year undergrad, it wasn’t easy to sell myself as a purveyor of useful knowledge. However, I tried to emphasize my experiences organizing student groups and broad knowledge of important emerging technologies like web development and cryptocurrency. I got a 40% response rate.
                </p>
                <p>
                My one-on-ones tended to focus mostly on object-level concerns like the future of programming languages or which economics concepts were most important for EAs. Much of the value of the one-on-one comes when you dive deep into your conversation partner’s areas of expertise rather than focus on the broad ideas repeated at talks. Don’t underestimate the value of object-level conversations like this.
                </p>
                <p>
                Next time, I’ll take more time to schedule one-on-ones in advance while still leaving plenty of gaps for unplanned one-on-ones with people I meet at the conference.
                </p>
                <p>
                Perhaps the most striking part of the conference was the average age of its attendees. Here are the data:

                Professional Demographics At EAGx According to Swapcard:

                <ul>
                <li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                Of all the attendees, 40.6% were undergrads! This comes from the tireless effort of EA university groups to recruit college students. Prominent groups like Harvard EA, MIT EA, Berkeley EA, and Stanford EA were well-represented, but there was also an unexpectedly strong presence from newer organizations like the University of Michigan and Amherst College (whose EA group is so large relative to the school’s size that 1 in 10 Amherst students are members).
                </p>
                <p>
                I thank EA Global for providing travel support and free tickets to these students. This was generous and impactful and the conference was better for it.
                </p>
                <p>
                It felt strange to be one of the few university-age people I met who got into EA through the internet rather than a university or high school group.
                </p>
                <p>
                The point to take away is that EA remains a <em>young</em> movement whose traction will only grow as its members age. I spoke to people already running EA groups in powerful companies like Facebook and Bloomberg, a trend we can expect to continue as all these undergrad EAs move into industry. Some will go into academia to establish new departments in their respective universities. Others will obtain lucrative positions and earn to give. Still others will continue community-building in their companies and regions. For all these paths, there were some people who had done before, happy to give advice.
                </p>
                <p>
                I attended only two talks, first <em>AI Policy Q&amp;A</em>, and then I switched about 3/4 of the way through to <em>Better, nor Perfect.</em> (By the way, if you aren’t gaining any value from a talk, it’s okay to leave. Your time is valuable and as a speaker I would rather have people enjoy my talk rather than politely sit through it.) The speaker explained the importance of deliberation as a decision-making tool as opposed to intuition (which is subject to bias), and the Q&amp;A veered into some interesting ethical territory, with discussion on framework application and the ever-present debate about whether we can’t implement utilitarianism day-to-day. I’ve never taken a philosophy class, so this was some of my first experience with philosophy in practice, and it was amazing to hear many people talking about ideas I had previously only read about in books.
                </p>
                <p>
                Politically speaking, EA is a private lobbying group. People I spoke to believed that the weirdness of EA ideas makes public appeals likely to fail, so we shouldn’t expect an explicitly-EA candidate on the scene anytime soon. For now, the most EA-aligned public politician I know of is Carrick Flynn, an Oregonian congressional candidate whose official platform features mainly vanilla democratic issues with a sprinkling of biorisk mitigation. Meanwhile, EA policy professionals focus on increasing competence among civil servants, especially in tech departments. I understand the motivation behind this strategy, but it still irks me. Is it okay to go over the head of the general public to push for ideas you believe in? This may run against the spirit of democracy, though many EAs might say that this quibble pales in comparison to the damage of not achieving longtermist goals. Then again, <em>every</em> political party or think tank claims this.
                </p>
                <p>
                During a one-on-one I updated my beliefs on the importance of AI Safety. I was unaware of many of the more recent developments by DeepMind and OpenAI and also unaware of some of the reasons why an unaligned AI might be dangerous. I’m still exploring career options for what to do with my computer science degree once I earn it, but AI Safety research continues to be on the table.
                </p>
                <p>
                I attended many office hours and booth sessions. Standouts included the Fish Welfare Initiative and Wave. There are plenty of openings for software engineers to do useful work that’s not AI-related, so CS undergrads in EA have many options.
                </p>
                <p>
                The food was amazing. I had no idea that vegan chicken could taste so good.
                </p>
                <p>
                Finally, I think I’m starting to get the hang of networking. The cadence of conversation, remembering people and why they’re good to know, “pitching” yourself and your work– these are all valuable skills that grow with practice. Not only do I know many more cool people now, but I also know <em>how to meet</em> many more cool people. If you give a man a fish, he’ll eat for a day…
                </p>
                <p>
                What to do better next time:
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>
                Stay for the entire event. I decided to leave a day early to give myself an extra day of work time for school. This wasn’t a <em>bad</em> idea, but in hindsight one extra day of EAGx is probably worth more than one extra day of school, even if it’s a day on which I’ll miss certain lectures.
                </li>
                <li>
                Consider volunteering as a good way to learn more about the type of work involved in community building.
                </li>
                <li>
                Come in with a few ideas you specifically want to learn more about and target people for one-on-ones who have interesting takes on those ideas.
                </li>
