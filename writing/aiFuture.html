<p>This short article of mine appeared in a student newspaper (February 2023) as a level-headed report to a non-technical audience on the likely effects of AI on the work world.</p>
<h1 id="ai-and-the-future-of-work">AI and the Future of Work</h1>
<p>ChatGPT and DALL-E 2 sound a wake-up call for the few remaining AI pessimists. With over a billion people now having access to models capable of creativity and basic reasoning, concerns about job loss are understandable. But what do experts predict for the future of AI and labor? To start with, AI will create jobs by boosting growth overall, with North America gaining the most after Asia<sup>1</sup>. This may improve lagging productivity growth and research productivity in wealthy countries.<sup>2</sup> However, the rich will disproportionately enjoy these gains. For small businesses and developing countries, access to data to train specialized models remains a challenge. <sup>3</sup> Although more data is available for generalist models, the price tag for training ones as powerful as GPT-3 remains high<sup>4</sup>, at least for now. AI integration will add to the growing wealth inequality of the global workforce. Demand for workers with high-tech skills will increase while less skilled workers will see their jobs at risk.<sup>3</sup> Nobody knows how many jobs will disappear<sup>5</sup>, but AI will likely shape every profession in some way.<sup>7</sup> Marketing and writing careers will see changes as AI makes content creation more efficient. However, experts believe that as language models continue to improve<sup>6</sup>, creative professions will adapt and survive. In the long term, AI may have a leveling effect as it empowers creators to do more with smaller budgets. Imagine an animator being able to create feature films with the help of AI doing the underdrawings, or a web startup being able to replace pricey software engineers with AI. While in the short term, AI may widen the gap of disparity, in the long-term, it can benefit us all.</p>
