<p>Wellâ€¦ the study of elliptic curves involves a bunch of complicated expressions like what your high school self might have imagined. Sometimes, notes will just explode into a trainwreck of terms like</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}\psi_1 &amp;= 1 \\ \psi_2 &amp;= 2y \\ \psi_3 &amp;= 3x^4 + 6Ax^2 + 12Bx - A^2 \\ \psi_4 &amp;= 4y(x^6 + 5Ax^4 + 20Bx^3 - 5A^2x^2 - 4ABx - A^3 - 8B^2).\end{align*}\]</span></p>
