        <p>Why Blog?</p>
        <p>After reading enough books and hearing enough chatter, there comes a point when a brain overflows and makes its own ideas. It is like every fact, figure, and opinion throws another particle of dust into a cosmic accretion disk. Once the cloud reaches critical mass, it ignites and produces its own light.</p>
        <p>This happened to me a long time ago, but I haven’t shared most of my ideas in writing yet for two reasons:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>My writing lacks polish.</li>
        <li>Why would anyone want to read what I have to say?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Problem #1 will fade with time and practice. Problem #2 is peskier.</p>
        <p>Why do people read? Either they have an obligation to or they think they will get something out of it. We can rule out the first case for blogs, so people will read this blog if they think they can get something out of it; something that this blog has that other blogs don’t have, or perhaps a unique combination or flavor of such things.</p>
        <p>What do I offer? I’m a first year computer science major at a well-regarded state university. I have many interests: technology, math, science, history, literature, and philosophy… writing is how I sate my curiosity. I’m willing to gamble that the number of unfound gems still exceeds the people who mine them, and that a few of my ideas will shine as I bring them into the light. The reader will judge if I’m correct.</p>
        <p>While keeping this blog at least partially anonymous, I’ll also talk about my life here. Why would you care? I don’t know, but I suspect many of you will find a reason. I’ve often been engaged by authors who sprinkle personal details on their writing. It gives an impression of scene. It personalizes them and illuminates their biases. In the end, you’ll probably value the autobiographical asides for the same reason you value them in conversation. My journey can illuminate yours.</p>
        <p>All this being said, I expect low readership and will focus on improving my skills and making sense out of the grand adventure that is college. Even if no one else gains value from this blog, it may be of some slight interest (and probable embarrassment) to my future self. That is enough.</p>
