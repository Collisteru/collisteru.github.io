What do I want to do with this website?


# Todo:
* Create an essay directory with a table of essays and descriptions, sortable by topic and date

* Under essays: a place for all my essays, written in Markdown and converted into HTMl format using Pandoc
test

* Color Palette


* Change clicked link color to be more aesthetically pleasing
* Draw full menu and single page layout. Keep in mind the eventual structure of the Ergodic Epic; you'll want to be able to include PDFs

* Constrain scroll width so that resizing doesn't squish text

## Blog Formatting:

* Upload representative essays, make sure everything is formatted okay

## Art:
* Draw space backgroud
* Draw Earth image, replace at bottom




* Add mobile support



# Done:

* A homepage with a list of links to my about page, my writings, my github, and my meeting
* * A beige center with the text itself surrounded by a blue background
* * Center-Justified text with wide margins
